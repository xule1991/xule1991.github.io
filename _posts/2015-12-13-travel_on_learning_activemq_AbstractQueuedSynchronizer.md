 * <tt>AbstractOwnableSynchronizer</tt> class itself does not manage or
 * use this information. However, subclasses and tools may use
 * appropriately maintained values to help control and monitor access
 * and provide diagnostics.

###AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
######This class is designed to be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a single atomic <tt>int</tt> value to represent state.
######To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying the synchronization state using {@link #getState}, {@link #setState} and/or {@link #compareAndSetState}:

- tryAcquire
- tryRelease
- tryAcquireShared
- tryReleaseShared
- isHeldExclusively


###methods child classes to provide synchronization
- java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.getState()
- java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.setState(int)
- java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.compareAndSetState(int, int)

###Mutex
```
class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {
 *
 *   // Our internal helper class
 *   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
 *     // Report whether in locked state
 *     protected boolean isHeldExclusively() {
 *       return getState() == 1;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Acquire the lock if state is zero
 *     public boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
 *       assert acquires == 1; // Otherwise unused
 *       if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
 *         setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread.currentThread());
 *         return true;
 *       }
 *       return false;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Release the lock by setting state to zero
 *     protected boolean tryRelease(int releases) {
 *       assert releases == 1; // Otherwise unused
 *       if (getState() == 0) throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
 *       setExclusiveOwnerThread(null);

 *     // Provide a Condition
 *     Condition newCondition() { return new ConditionObject(); }
 *
 *     // Deserialize properly
 *     private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s)
 *         throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
 *       s.defaultReadObject();
 *       setState(0); // reset to unlocked state
 *     }
 *   }
 *   // The sync object does all the hard work. We just forward to it.
 *   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
 *
 *   public void lock()                { sync.acquire(1); }
 *   public boolean tryLock()          { return sync.tryAcquire(1); }
 *   public void unlock()              { sync.release(1); }

 *   public boolean tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
 *       throws InterruptedException {
 *     return sync.tryAcquireNanos(1, unit.toNanos(timeout));
 *   }
 * }
```

###BooleanLatch
######Here is a latch class that is like a {@link CountDownLatch} except that it only requires a single signal> to fire. Because a latch is non-exclusive, it uses the shared acquire and release methods.
```
class BooleanLatch {
 *
 *   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
 *     boolean isSignalled() { return getState() != 0; }
 *
 *     protected int tryAcquireShared(int ignore) {
 *       return isSignalled() ? 1 : -1;
 *     }
 *
 *     protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int ignore) {
 *       setState(1);
 *       return true;
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
 *   public boolean isSignalled() { return sync.isSignalled(); }
 *   public void signal()         { sync.releaseShared(1); }
 *   public void await() throws InterruptedException {
 *     sync.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1);
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * 

```

###Node
```
  static final class Node {
        /** Marker to indicate a node is waiting in shared mode */
        static final Node SHARED = new Node();
        /** Marker to indicate a node is waiting in exclusive mode */
        static final Node EXCLUSIVE = null;

        /** waitStatus value to indicate thread has cancelled */
        static final int CANCELLED =  1;
        /** waitStatus value to indicate successor's thread needs unparking */
        static final int SIGNAL    = -1;
        /** waitStatus value to indicate thread is waiting on condition */
        static final int CONDITION = -2;
        /**
         * waitStatus value to indicate the next acquireShared should
         * unconditionally propagate
         */
        static final int PROPAGATE = -3;

        /**
         * Status field, taking on only the values:
         *   SIGNAL:     The successor of this node is (or will soon be)
         *               blocked (via park), so the current node must
         *               unpark its successor when it releases or
         *               cancels. To avoid races, acquire methods must
         *               first indicate they need a signal,
         *               then retry the atomic acquire, and then,
         *               on failure, block.
         *   CANCELLED:  This node is cancelled due to timeout or interrupt.
         *               Nodes never leave this state. In particular,
         *               a thread with cancelled node never again blocks.
         *   CONDITION:  This node is currently on a condition queue.
         *               It will not be used as a sync queue node
         *               until transferred, at which time the status
         *               will be set to 0. (Use of this value here has
         *               nothing to do with the other uses of the
         *               field, but simplifies mechanics.)
         *   PROPAGATE:  A releaseShared should be propagated to other
         *               nodes. This is set (for head node only) in
         *               doReleaseShared to ensure propagation
         *               continues, even if other operations have
         *               since intervened.
         *   0:          None of the above
         *
         * The values are arranged numerically to simplify use.
         * Non-negative values mean that a node doesn't need to
         * signal. So, most code doesn't need to check for particular
         * values, just for sign.
         *
         * The field is initialized to 0 for normal sync nodes, and
         * CONDITION for condition nodes.  It is modified using CAS
         * (or when possible, unconditional volatile writes).

         * cancellation of a predecessor, we short-circuit while
         * finding a non-cancelled one, which will always exist
         * because the head node is never cancelled: A node becomes
         * head only as a result of successful acquire. A
