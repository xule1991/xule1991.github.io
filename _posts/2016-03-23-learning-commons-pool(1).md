###Implementation of my own connection pool

```
	Connections is an interface which contains:
	
	Connection getConnection(String url, String db);
	void releaseConnection(String url, String db, Connection connection)// maybe it should not be called release
	
	ConnectionsImpl which implements Connections contains:

	private final int POOL_SIZE = 3; // init connection number for 
    private final String URL_FORMAT = "jdbc:mysql://%s:3306/%s";
