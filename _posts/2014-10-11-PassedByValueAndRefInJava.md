> String, Wrapper and Primitive is passed by value

```c
This issue is met on an interview, I need to deal with big add based on linkedlist.Given carry-out, we need to pass num,num and carry to add method, at that time I thought, that I can use Integer to pass the carry and it will passed by ref, the interviewer ask me how can you pass this way, and I told him because it is an object...I find this grammer issue when I code it on machine.Any way, I got the offer, fighting~   
```

乐此不疲～
