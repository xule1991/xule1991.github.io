>First day on continuing to study source code, need to track every issues met and then blog them.


```
	1. the maven repo china:
			http://maven.oschina.net/content/groups/public/
	2. create a new gitignore on windows, we need to use editor to create a new file then save as ".gitignore", then it can be saved.
	3. create a new project on github:
		create a new one on github.com
		git add README
		# Stages your README file, adding it to the list of files to be committed
		git commit -m 'first commit'
		# Commits your files, adding the message "first commit"
		git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
		# Creates a remote named "origin" pointing at your GitHub repository
		git push origin master
		# Sends your commits in the "master" branch to GitHub
		
		
```
