> Some understandings from reading reading Code complete(2nd)


"ADT" abstract data type:

```	
	We usually make ADT for common bottom layer data type to malipulate that data, do not operate bottom layer data directly,sth as follows:
	
	currentFont.setSize();
	currentFont.setBoldOn();
	currentFont.setBoldOff();
	currentFont.setItalicOn();
	currentFont.setItalicOff();
	currentFont.setTypeFace();
	
	etc.
	
	If you are not use OOP, you can not do this kind of operation on a object, you need to write the method directly, 
```

```
  
```



	
	乐此不疲～
